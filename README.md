    Enable the user to login and if he don't have an account, signup.
    The user can log out or go to settings, where can change his profile picture, that he can take from the camera or the device's gallery.
    He can also view contacts, which are the users registered in the app.
    The user can start a conversation with a contact, by clicking on it and send a message or image from the gallery.
    The messages that the user sends appear in green, and those that receives in white.
    The App has a different pattern for IOS and Android.
